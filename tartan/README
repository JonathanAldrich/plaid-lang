To run those tasks, you need to install Rake.
The simple way to install Rake is type command "gem install rake".

Before using Tartan compiler, you need to build up Tartan environment.
From the command line, navigate to the tartan directory under plaid-lang downloaded in Step 1 and type "rake prepare".

5. Compile application
Once the environment is set up, you can compile source code written in Tartan.
To compile example apprication, just type command "rake compiler".
Then, Tartan code will be compiled into Plaid, then Plaid code will be compiled into JavaScript.
Additionally, HTML file (todolist.html) to run the application is generated in html directory.

6. Get jQuery and fix the path to it in HTML file
Since Tartan depends on jQuery, you need to get jQuery and put it in your favorite path.
Then open "todolist.html" file generated in the previous step with your favorite editor and fix the path to jQuery
(jQuery is included as the first javascript library in header element).
