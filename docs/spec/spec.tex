\abstract{
Plaid is an object oriented programming language built on two paradigms.  First, Plaid
is {\it typestate-oriented}. Programmers can directly encode the {\it abstract states}
of objects and use the {\it state change operator} to change the state, interface, and representation
of an object at runtime.  Second, Plaid's type system is {\it permission-based}.  The type of each reference 
includes an {\it access permission} which dictates how the reference can be used and characterizes
the permissions to other aliases of the same object.  Plaid leverages permissions 
when tracking the abstract state of references during typechecking.  Permissions are
also used to infer code that can be safely run in parallel.
This document defines the core of the Plaid language, including its source syntax, 
the semantics of operations involving abstract states, and a type system.
