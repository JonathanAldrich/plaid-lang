/**
 *	Top level state representing all Permissions.
 *	We have two main classes of Permission:
 *		Source Permissions - these are permissions that can appear
 *			in a source program attached to a reference.  They include
 *			Base Permissions and Local Permissions and the dynamic permission
 *		System Permissions - these are permissions that are needed for
 *			for tracking during typechecking but are not normally
 *			expressible in the source.  These included Borrowed Permissions
 *			and the none permission (only expressible as a end state and then
 *			only with no state information).
 *
 *  We give the full Permission hierarchy here and explain the details in
 *  the various source files
 *
 *  Permission ::= SourcePermission | SystemPermission
 *  SourcePermission ::= BasePermission | local(SymmetricPermission) | dynamic
 *  BasePermission ::= SingularPermission | SymmetricPermission
 *  SingularPermission ::= unique ( | full )
 *  SymmetricPermission ::= immutable | shared ( | pure )
 *  SystemPermission ::= borrow(SymmetricPermission,Integer,SourcePermission)
 *  			       | none 
 *
 *
 *  This is what the permission lattice looks like based on current and (future) permissions
 *  This lattice is defined by the splitting operations.  A permission, p, is
 *  a subpermission of another permission p' if and only if p' can be split from p.
 *  Note that dynamic is not comparable with any other permissions
 *  and that the borrow forms are only comparable to the corresponding
 *  local permission and none.
 * TODO: explain non-symmetric nature
